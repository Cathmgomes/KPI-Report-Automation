# KPI-Report-Automation
Python program to automate the creation of reports and KPIs for a company with multiple stores, sending it to specific emails.
The main challenge was to create an automation that calculated different KPIs for 25 different stores, separating the data into different files, generating a comparison table per store, considering the goal for each KPI. After the calculation, each manager had to receive an individual email with only the report and the table of their store and the board had to receive a ranking of all stores, by daily and annual result.
To approach this challenge, I have to integrate different libraries to automate not only the creation of the reports and KPIs but also the e-mails.
In this project I also used HTML for writing the e-mail and create a customized table.
